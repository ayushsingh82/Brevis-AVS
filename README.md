# Brevis5Flow

Brevis5Flow is a modular framework that enhances user engagement, security, and platform efficiency through various custom hooks. These hooks use historical user data and real-time market conditions, verified by Brevis zk-proofs, to deliver tailored experiences in decentralized applications.

## Project Hooks

### 1. User-Gating Hook
The **User-Gating Hook** grants exclusive access to certain features based on users' historical behavior. This functionality encourages loyalty by rewarding users who engage consistently.

**How It Works**
- **Proof Submission**: Users submit proof of eligibility based on their historical interactions with the platform.
- **Verification Process**: The hook verifies this proof, checking if the user meets eligibility criteria based on past behavior.
- **Access Granted**: Eligible users gain access to exclusive features, rewarding loyalty and encouraging continued engagement.

### 2. Fee Adjustment Hook
The **Fee Adjustment Hook** dynamically adjusts trading fees based on a user's trading history. This incentivizes high-frequency traders with reduced fees, fostering engagement and loyalty.

**How It Works**
- **Order Placement**: Traders place an order and submit proof of their trading history as part of the process.
- **Verification Process**: The hook checks historical trading activity to determine the appropriate fee rate.
- **Fee Rate Adjustment**: Based on trading behavior, eligible high-frequency traders receive a reduced fee (e.g., 5%), while regular traders incur a standard fee (e.g., 1%).

### 3. Wallet Recovery Hook
The **Wallet Recovery Hook** provides a secure method for users to recover wallets by verifying identity and historical on-chain behavior, enhancing user trust.

**How It Works**
- **Identity Verification**: The wallet owner submits proof of their identity and on-chain activity as part of the recovery process.
- **Eligibility Verification**: The hook checks the submitted proof to confirm the user’s criteria for wallet recovery.
- **Secure Wallet Recovery**: Upon successful verification, the user can securely recover their wallet, enhancing platform trust and security.

### 4. Loyalty Retention Hook
The **Loyalty Retention Hook** rewards users for engagement by tracking loyalty points based on their platform activity. This encourages frequent interactions, promoting long-term retention.

**How It Works**
- **Engagement Tracking**: User activities on the platform are monitored to track loyalty behavior.
- **Loyalty Points Calculation**: Loyalty points are calculated based on engagement levels, rewarding users with points for each interaction.
- **Points Redemption**: Users can redeem loyalty points for discounts or perks, encouraging ongoing platform interaction and enhancing loyalty.

### 5. Active Liquidity Management Hook
The **Active Liquidity Management Hook** manages market liquidity dynamically by adjusting available liquidity based on verified market conditions, ensuring efficient and trust-free liquidity adjustments.

**How It Works**
- **Trigger Events**: Market activities like high volatility or trade volume serve as triggers for liquidity adjustments.
- **Liquidity Evaluation**: The hook uses Brevis zk-proofs to verify market conditions and determine the need for liquidity changes.
- **Liquidity Adjustment**: Liquidity is either added or removed based on the evaluation, optimizing market efficiency and maintaining balance.

## Benefits of Brevis5Flow
- **Enhanced User Engagement**: Tailored user experiences through loyalty and fee adjustments.
- **Improved Security**: Secure wallet recovery and access gating.
- **Optimized Market Operations**: Dynamic liquidity management ensures market efficiency.
- **Decentralized Trust**: Brevis zk-proofs enable trust-free verifications, enhancing security across functionalities.
